# HEVD Stable LPE – Arbitrary Read/Write (Write-What-Where)

🚀 Proof-of-Concept exploit against **HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver (HEVD)** leveraging the **Arbitrary Write-What-Where** vulnerability to achieve **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE)** on Windows.

This implementation is made stable across different **Windows 10 builds** by dynamically resolving `EPROCESS` field offsets via **pattern scanning** of `ntoskrnl.exe`.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **Dynamic offset resolution** for:
  - `UniqueProcessId`
  - `Token`
  - `ActiveProcessLinks`
- 📖 Pattern scanning directly inside `ntoskrnl.exe`
- ⚡ Arbitrary **read/write primitives**
- 🛠️ Clean code, separated into headers/sources
- 🐚 Spawns a SYSTEM shell (`cmd.exe`) once successful
- 💡 Data-only exploit → bypasses most kernel mitigations (SMEP, CFG, etc.)


## ⚙️ Build

- Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nxvertime/HEVD-STABLE-LPE-WRITE-WHAT-WHERE.git
   cd HEVD-STABLE-LPE-WRITE-WHAT-WHERE
   ```
- Open hevd_arbitrary_rw.sln with Visual Studio
- Build in x64 / Release
- Ensure HEVD.sys is loaded on the target system


## 🚀 Usage
- Load HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver:

    ```bash
    sc create HEVD type= kernel binPath= C:\Path\To\HEVD.sys
    sc start HEVD
    ```
- Run the exploit binary as low-privileged user

- Enjoy your SYSTEM shell:

## 🧪 Tested On
Microsoft Windows 10 (build 19044.1288)

Works reliably across multiple W10 builds thanks to dynamic offset scanning
